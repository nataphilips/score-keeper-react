## Score Keeper project

My first project in React.

### `how it works`

If you play a score based game with a friend, this app is just for you!
Set a winning score and make the machine remember and add up your score on a simple click.
No more pen and pencil required to find out who won the game.

### `code to show`

* Basic React syntax
* Styled components syntax
* How to extract a styled component
